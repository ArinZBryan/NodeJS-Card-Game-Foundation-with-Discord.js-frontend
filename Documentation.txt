To set up a game:
  game = new game()
  game.new_player(number of players wanted)
  game.new_pile(1)
  game.new_deck(game.piles[0].id)

to sort cards
  game.players[game.find_by_id(player's id)].sortDeck(method)
  
  methods are:
    "pure-numerical-ascending"
    "pure-numerical-descending"
    "by-suit"
    "ascending-numerical-by-suit"
    "descending-numerical-by suit"
    
 to find an game element by its id:
    game.find_by_id(id)
    returns [type,parent,value (if card),suit (if card)]
    types:  "card"
            "pile"
            "player"
